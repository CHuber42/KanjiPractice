# Kanji Practice Randomizer

### This tool tracks the dictionary of Kanji you've entered, and assigns one at random to practice.

this is stored.

## Basic operation of the tool:

From command line:
addKanji.py "arg" will add arg to the list of kanji you want to practice.

__arg can be any text prompt you wish, be it "go" or "go (as in 'after')",
for clarification!__ 

RanKanjiSelector.py will present a prompt. X exits program - all others
result in a new random entry.

### Possible support for the future:

* Bundle addKanji.py script into RanKanjiSelector, once calling a specific
func from command line is learned.

* Add func to remove mastered Kanji from the practice list

* Add ability to display the Kanji at prompt, if reminder is required
(IE, a "dictionary")
